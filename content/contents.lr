__Hey there!__ Looks like you found us,

PyCampers is techno religion, which preaches the python programming language.

_You know, that one, the one that makes programming in it feel like "cheating"._

We need techno religions, because the old one's were never designed with technology in mind.    

[Learn more here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6BK5Q_Dblo). TLDR; People who wrote religious texts never had access to technology.

## Join us, will ye?

No, we're not a bunch of crazy people, we're actual developers just like yourself.   

## Why Python?

> Python is the second best language for __everything__.

_And that's not a bad thing._

__It's absolutely Incredible.__  

Just `$ pip install antigravity`, and you do almost anything you want.   

Humankind has yet to see a tool that has this kind of power.

We're just here to let everyone realise this fact, and hopefully, one day, make python the __first__ best language for everything.
